      <h1>Your Microfrontend is not here</h1>
      <p>
        The basic-parcel microfrontend is running in "integrated" mode, since
        standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin is disabled. This means that it
        does not work as a standalone application without changing
        configuration.
      </p>
      <h2>How do I develop this microfrontend?</h2>
      <p>To develop this microfrontend, try the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy the following URL to your clipboard:
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" id="mf-url"></a>
        </li>
        <li>
          In a new browser tab, go to the your single-spa web app. This is where
          your "root config" is running. You do not have to run the root config
          locally if it is already running on a deployed environment - go to the
          deployed environment directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the browser console, run
          <code>localStorage.setItem('devtools', true);</code> Refresh the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          A yellowish rectangle should appear at the bottom right of your
          screen. Click on it. Find the name basic-parcel and click on it. If it
          is not present, click on Add New Module.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paste the URL above into the input that appears. Refresh the page.
        </li>
        <li>Congrats, your local code is now being used!</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <h2>If you prefer Standalone mode</h2>
      <p>
        To run this microfrontend in "standalone" mode, the
        standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin must not be disabled. More details
